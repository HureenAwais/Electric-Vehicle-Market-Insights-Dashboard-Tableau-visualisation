# Electric Vehicle Market Dashboard (Tableau)

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard analysing electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends and manufacturer market share over time.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard provides insights into:
- Total EV adoption trends by model year
- Market share of leading EV manufacturers over time
- Comparison of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)
- Top 10 BEV manufacturers by electric range
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) for total EV, BEV, and PHEV counts

Manufacturers with small individual market share are grouped as **“Other”** to improve visualization clarity and focus on major market players.

## Features
- Interactive filters for:
  - Electric vehicle type (BEV / PHEV)
  - Electric range
  - Manufacturer
- KPI summary cards for quick comparison
- Time-series and stacked bar charts for trend analysis

## Tools Used
- Tableau Public
- Microsoft Excel (data preparation)

## Purpose
This dashboard was created as a data visualization and analytics project to explore electric vehicle market growth and manufacturer distribution using interactive visual storytelling.
## Data Source
